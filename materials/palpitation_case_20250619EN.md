# Patient-Facing Explanation: Detailed AI Output (Case of Palpitations, Generated by Gemini)

## Overview

This document presents a detailed example of output generated by AI (Gemini 2.5) to visualize how such information can support clinical decision-making in an acupuncture clinic.

## Prompt (Question Input)

**Patient Profile:**

- Female, age 65
- Overweight
- No prior medical history
- Family history of angina (mother)
- Main complaint is shoulder stiffness, but she also reports palpitations

**Prompt Content:**

> Are the palpitations caused by an organic issue like a heart or arrhythmia problem, or are they due to autonomic or psychological causes?  
> Ideally, the patient would first visit a hospital and receive a medical evaluation to rule out any organic problems before coming to an acupuncture clinic. However, this is not always feasible.  
> In which cases should an immediate referral to a medical institution be recommended?

## AI-Generated Output (Gemini 2.5)

During intake at an acupuncture clinic, determining whether a patient's palpitations are due to organic issues or related to autonomic or psychological causes is critically important. In this case—65-year-old woman, overweight, with a family history of angina—there is an elevated risk of cardiovascular issues.

### When to Strongly Recommend Medical Evaluation

1. **Palpitations with Alarming Symptoms**  
   Palpitations accompanied by the following symptoms may indicate serious cardiac disease:
   - **Chest pain or tightness**, especially if radiating to the left arm, jaw, or back.
   - **Shortness of breath**, even at rest or with minimal exertion.
   - **Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting**, suggesting temporary cerebral hypoperfusion due to arrhythmia or circulatory instability.
   - **Cold sweat or pale complexion**, possibly indicating shock.
   - **Confusion or altered consciousness**, a sign of severe medical condition.

2. **Characteristics of the Palpitations**
   - **Sudden onset and cessation**: May indicate paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
   - **Very rapid (over 120 bpm) or very slow (under 50 bpm) pulse**, especially at rest.
   - **Irregular and erratic rhythm**: Possible atrial fibrillation.
   - **Prolonged duration**: Palpitations lasting several hours require attention.
   - **Persisting at rest**: Palpitations that continue even without exertion should be assessed carefully.

3. **Medical and Family History**
   - Underlying conditions such as **hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia** increase cardiac risk.
   - **Family history of angina (mother)**: Hereditary risk must be considered.
   - **History of abnormal ECG findings**: If the patient has previously had cardiac tests, it is important to review those results.

4. **Impact on Daily Life**
   - Palpitations interfering with **daily activities, work, sleep, or home life**.
   - **Severe anxiety**: While the palpitations may be psychogenic, high anxiety in the absence of a confirmed diagnosis warrants medical assessment and possibly psychological support.

## Acupuncturist’s Role

If any of the above warning signs are present, do not hesitate to strongly recommend immediate referral to a medical institution. Rather than saying simply “Please go to the hospital,” offer specific phrasing such as:

- “To be safe, let’s have a cardiologist check your heart.”
- “I recommend seeing a cardiovascular specialist to determine the cause of the palpitations.”

If the patient hesitates, clearly explain that symptoms like chest pain or shortness of breath may place strain on the heart and emphasize the importance of early detection and treatment.

Once a medical professional has ruled out organic causes, acupuncture treatment targeting autonomic imbalance or psychogenic factors can then be considered—with patient safety as the highest priority.

## Practitioner’s Comment

Using a more specific prompt resulted in a more detailed AI output.  
However, from the patient's perspective, the explanation may have become overly technical and harder to understand.  
In real-life use of AI as a decision-support tool, this must be taken into account, and it is the responsibility of the acupuncturist to interpret and communicate the output in an accessible way.  
The AI-generated information should be treated as a reference only; final clinical judgment and explanation remain solely the responsibility of the practitioner.
