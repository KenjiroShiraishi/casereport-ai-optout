## 📄 Project Overview

This repository documents the implementation of a transparent AI disclosure and opt-out protocol at a solo acupuncture clinic in Japan. The initiative was developed in response to emerging concerns around the ethical use of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical communication, particularly with respect to patient autonomy and informed consent.

The AI tools used (e.g., large language models like ChatGPT) are employed only in anonymized, supplementary roles—for example, to access reference information or enhance explanation clarity. Patients are notified of this usage and provided with an opt-out option.

- **Survey Plan** *(in preparation)*:  
  A short patient survey is being conducted to assess responses to AI disclosure in a real-world clinical setting. Data will be anonymized and made available in this repository.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

As AI adoption grows across healthcare, even small-scale clinics must address its ethical implications. This case provides:

- A **replicable model** for AI opt-out protocols in private practice  
- A **patient-centered communication framework**  
- A real-world example supporting future policy and academic debate

## 📁 Examples / Experiments / Results

This folder contains real-world test cases demonstrating how AI-generated diagnostic suggestions can be presented and contextualized for patient communication in clinical practice (e.g., acupuncture).

### 🔍 Available Cases

- [palpitation_case_20250619JP.md](./examples/experiments/results/palpitation_case_20250619JP.md) — Japanese version  
- [palpitation_case_20250619EN.md](./examples/experiments/results/palpitation_case_20250619EN.md) — English version  

Each case file includes:

- Patient prompt with brief medical context  
- Gemini 2.5-generated output (diagnostic suggestion and triage reasoning)  
- Practitioner commentary on interpretability and ethical responsibility  

These examples are part of the broader SML-CML framework project, which aims to evaluate AI outputs based on semantic meaning layers and worldview alignment in clinical reasoning.
