## üìÑ Project Overview

This repository documents the implementation of a transparent AI disclosure and opt-out protocol at a solo acupuncture clinic in Japan. The initiative was developed in response to emerging concerns around the ethical use of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical communication, particularly with respect to patient autonomy and informed consent.

The AI tools used (e.g., large language models like ChatGPT) are employed only in anonymized, supplementary roles‚Äîfor example, to access reference information or enhance explanation clarity. Patients are notified of this usage and provided with an opt-out option.

## üß† Why This Matters

As AI adoption grows across healthcare, even small-scale clinics must address its ethical implications. This case provides:

- A **replicable model** for AI opt-out protocols in private practice  
- A **patient-centered communication framework**  
- A real-world example supporting future policy and academic debate
